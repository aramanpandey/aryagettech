		<p id="sp"class="text-justify">praise. Hemraj was different. Never had we heard him speak of what was now revealed on visiting his school. On seeing strangers around the school, a few villagers too came there. The children told us that ‘Balsakha’ thought of all his students as his friends. He had even made cushions for his students to sit on. It was not just the question of a certain comfort to be made available to the children; the point was that Hemraj had made every single one of these cushions himself. We wondered at the intimacy, love and sensitivity that went into this act.
In the following pages you will read Hemraj’s diary. You will read about the challenges he faced as a teacher, the wars he waged every day, the system he wished to fight from within. In his diary, we are made aware of problems with roots so deep that it might take us generations to find effective solutions to them. All we hope for is that his clarity of thought and the purity of his intentions leave an indelible impression on one and all, inspiring us into though</p>
